# Student Grade Prediction

## Abstract  
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict students’ academic performance based on background and academic attributes such as travel time, study habits, family support, and prior academic records. The study aims to evaluate the predictive capability of multiple models and analyze the influence of selected features on student outcomes. Three machine learning models were developed and compared using standard evaluation metrics to identify the most effective approach for grade prediction.

## 1. Introduction  
Accurate prediction of academic performance can assist educational institutions in identifying students at risk and understanding factors that influence learning outcomes. This project focuses on leveraging data-driven methods to model student performance using socio-academic variables and machine learning techniques.
